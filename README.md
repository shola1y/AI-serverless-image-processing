Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin using the Serverless Image Handler, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

AWS Account:

You must have an AWS account to deploy and utilize the Serverless Image Handler.
AWS CLI:

Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to interact with AWS services from your local environment.
AWS Credentials:

Ensure that you have the necessary AWS credentials configured on your local machine. You can set up credentials using the AWS CLI or other methods as appropriate.
AWS Services:

The Serverless Image Handler relies on the following AWS services:
AWS CloudFormation:

Used for infrastructure as code, allowing you to define and provision AWS infrastructure in a secure and predictable manner.
Amazon CloudFront:

A content delivery network (CDN) service to securely and efficiently deliver images to users.
Amazon API Gateway:

Used to create, publish, and manage APIs, providing a secure and scalable API endpoint for your Serverless Image Handler.
AWS Lambda:

Enables you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, making it an ideal choice for serverless image processing functions.
Amazon S3:

A highly scalable object storage service used to store and retrieve images efficiently.
Amazon Rekognition (optional):

If leveraging image recognition features, ensure that the Amazon Rekognition service is configured and accessible.
AWS Secrets Manager (optional):

For securely storing and managing sensitive information, such as API keys or credentials.
Ensure that these services are set up, and you have the necessary permissions to deploy and manage resources within your AWS account.

Installation
To deploy the Serverless Image Handler, follow these steps:

Upload CloudFormation Template to Amazon S3:

If your CloudFormation template is stored locally, manually upload it to an Amazon S3 bucket. Ensure that the template is accessible for deployment.
Manually Launch the Serverless Image Handler AWS CloudFormation template:

Go to the AWS CloudFormation Console.
Click the "Create stack" button.
Choose "Upload a template file" and click "Choose file" to select your CloudFormation template from your local machine.
Click "Next" to proceed with the deployment.
Note: The template launches in the US East (N. Virginia) Region by default. To launch in a different AWS Region, use the Region selector in the console navigation bar.

On the Specify stack details page, assign a name to your solution stack.

Under Parameters, review and modify the solution parameters as necessary.

Click Next.

On the Configure stack options page, click Next.

On the Review page, review and confirm the settings. Select the box acknowledging that the template creates IAM resources.

Click Create stack to deploy the stack.

Monitor the stack status in the AWS CloudFormation console. Expect a CREATE_COMPLETE status in approximately 15 minutes.

Architecture
The Serverless Image Handler leverages a scalable and serverless architecture, seamlessly integrating several key AWS services to efficiently process and deliver images. Each service plays a crucial role in different stages of the image processing pipeline.


Flow Explanation
Client Request:

A client initiates a request for image processing by sending a request to the Amazon CloudFront distribution associated with the Serverless Image Handler.
CloudFront Distribution:

CloudFront acts as the CDN, forwarding the client request to the Amazon API Gateway.
Amazon API Gateway:

API Gateway manages the API, triggering an AWS Lambda function to handle the requested image processing features.
AWS Lambda:

The Lambda function retrieves the original image from Amazon S3, applies the specified features, and returns the processed image. Optionally, it may involve calls to Amazon Rekognition for facial recognition or content moderation.
Amazon S3 (Storage):

Both the original and processed images are stored in Amazon S3, ensuring durability and scalability.
Amazon Rekognition (Optional):

If needed, the Lambda function may interact with Amazon Rekognition for advanced image analysis.
Secrets Manager (Optional):

If signature validation is enabled, the Lambda function retrieves secret values from AWS Secrets Manager for added security.
Response to Client:

The Lambda function generates a response containing the processed image or relevant information, sent back through API Gateway and CloudFront to the client.
This orchestrated flow ensures that image processing is efficiently handled in a serverless manner, with scalability, security, and optimal performance.

Usage
Deploying the Serverless Image Handler
Upload CloudFormation Template:

Upload the CloudFormation template (serverless-image-handler-template.yaml) to an Amazon S3 bucket of your choice.
Launch the CloudFormation Stack:

Open the AWS CloudFormation Console.
Click "Create stack" and choose "With new resources."
In the "Specify template" section, choose "Amazon S3 URL" and enter the URL of your uploaded CloudFormation template.
Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the stack parameters and complete the deployment.
Configuring Lambda Function Features
Feature Configuration:
In the deployed Lambda function (ImageHandlerFunction), features such as smart cropping and content moderation are available.
Update the Lambda function code to customize the behavior based on your specific needs.
Testing the Image Handler
Invoke Lambda Function:

Use the AWS Lambda Console or AWS CLI to test the Lambda function manually.
Provide input parameters such as the imageKey (S3 object key) and the desired feature ('smartCropping' or 'contentModeration').
Inspect Results:

Review the Lambda function logs in the AWS CloudWatch Console for debugging and troubleshooting.
Demo UI (Optional)
Deploying the Demo UI:

If you opted to deploy the demo UI by setting the DeployDemoUI parameter to 'Yes,' a separate S3 bucket (DemoUIBucket) is created.
Upload your demo UI files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the demo UI bucket.
Accessing the Demo UI:

Once the demo UI is deployed, access it through the generated URL.
Additional Considerations
Security:

Review and enhance IAM roles and permissions for the Lambda function to adhere to security best practices.
Consider enabling AWS Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for S3 buckets if needed.
Error Handling:

Implement robust error handling in the Lambda function to handle various scenarios gracefully.
Testing and Optimization:

Test the solution thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying in production.
Optimize the Lambda function, CloudFront settings, and other configurations based on performance requirements.
Refer to the CloudFormation template, Lambda function code, and AWS documentation for detailed information on customization and advanced features.
